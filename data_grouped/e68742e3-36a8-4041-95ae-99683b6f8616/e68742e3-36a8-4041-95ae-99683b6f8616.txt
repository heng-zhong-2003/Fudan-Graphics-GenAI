I need a 3D model of a Victorian-style armchair. The chair should have an ornate, high backrest with intricate carvings. The armrests should be curved and detailed, matching the backrest. The seat should be cushioned and slightly elevated. The legs should be short but elaborately designed. Add some decorative patterns along the edges of the armchair.
