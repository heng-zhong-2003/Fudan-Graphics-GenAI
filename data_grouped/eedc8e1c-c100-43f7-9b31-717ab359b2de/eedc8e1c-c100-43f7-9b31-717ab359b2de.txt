Picture a recliner chair with a high backrest and cushioned seat. The chair has armrests on either side and a footrest that extends when the chair reclines. The reclining mechanism is smooth, allowing the user to adjust the angle for maximum comfort. The base is sturdy, ensuring the chair remains stable in all positions.
