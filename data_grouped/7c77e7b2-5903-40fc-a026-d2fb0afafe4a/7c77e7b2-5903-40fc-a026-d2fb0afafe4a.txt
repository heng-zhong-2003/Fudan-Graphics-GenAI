Please design a recliner chair with an adjustable backrest and footrest. The chair should have a high back, wide armrests, and a deep seat for added comfort. 

The backrest should be able to recline to multiple positions, and the footrest should extend out from the front of the chair when the backrest is reclined. Include a lever or button on the side of the chair to control the reclining mechanism. 

Ensure the chair has a sturdy base with four legs or a swivel base.
