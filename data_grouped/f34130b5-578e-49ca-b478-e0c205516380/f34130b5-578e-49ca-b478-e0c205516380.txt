Compare the design of a traditional recliner chair with a modern one. The traditional recliner should have a high back, padded armrests, and a lever on the side for reclining. The modern recliner should have a sleek, minimalist design with a push-button mechanism for reclining. Both should be comfortable for extended sitting.
